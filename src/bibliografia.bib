  abstract = { In the era of ubiquitous sensors and smart devices, detecting malware is becoming an endless battle between ever-evolving malware and antivirus programs that need to process ever-increasing security related data. For malware detection, various approaches have been proposed. Among them, dynamic analysis is known to be effective in terms of providing behavioral information. As malware authors increasingly use obfuscation techniques, it becomes more important to monitor how malware behaves for its detection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for dynamic analysis of malware. We adopt DNA sequence alignment algorithms and extract common API call sequence patterns of malicious function from malware in different categories. We find that certain malicious functions are commonly included in malware even in different categories. From checking the existence of certain functions or API call sequence patterns matched, we can even detect new unknown malware. The result of our experiment shows high enough F-measure and accuracy. API call sequence can be extracted from most of the modern devices; therefore, we believe that our method can detect the malware for all types of the ubiquitous devices. }

  abstract  = {Analyzing the usage of Windows Application Program Interface (API) is a common way to understand behaviors of Malicious Software (malware) in either static analysis or dynamic analysis methods. In this work, we focus on the usage of frequent messages in API call sequences, and we hypothesize that frequent itemsets composed of API names and/or API arguments could be valuable in the identification of the behavior of malware. For verification, we introduced clustering processes of malware binaries based on their frequent itemsets of API call sequences, and we evaluated the performance of malware clustering. Specific implementation processes for malware clustering, including API calls abstraction, frequent itemsets mining and similarity calculation, are illustrated. The experiment upon a big malware dataset demonstrated that merely using the frequent messages of API call sequences can achieve a high precision for malware clustering while significantly reducing the computation time. This also proves the importance of frequent itemsets in API call sequences for identifying the behavior of malware.},
